SECTION 3: INVENTORY WEIGHTING CALCULATION
================================================================================
How weighting works:
- deviation = current_ratio - target_ratio (0.50)
- weight = 1 - (deviation / max_skew_ratio)
- weight is clamped between 0 and 1
- Negative deviation (underweight) = weight clamped to 1.0
- Positive deviation (overweight) = weight reduced proportionally

SECTION 8: DECISION FLOWCHART (Text Version)
================================================================================
Step 1: Calculate base trade sizes
  UP Base = $0.75 + (UP_price × 10)
  DOWN Base = $0.75 + (DOWN_price × 10)

Step 2: Check price threshold (0.90)
  IF UP_price > 0.90 THEN DOWN_weight = 0 (stop trading DOWN)
  IF DOWN_price > 0.90 THEN UP_weight = 0 (stop trading UP)

Step 3: Calculate inventory weights (if not blocked by step 2)
  UP_deviation = current_UP_ratio - 0.50
  DOWN_deviation = current_DOWN_ratio - 0.50
  UP_weight = max(0, min(1, 1 - (UP_deviation / 0.20)))
  DOWN_weight = max(0, min(1, 1 - (DOWN_deviation / 0.20)))

Step 4: Calculate final trade amounts
  Final_UP_trade = UP_base × UP_weight
  Final_DOWN_trade = DOWN_base × DOWN_weight

Step 5: Execute trades
  IF Final_UP_trade >= $0.01 THEN place UP order
  IF Final_DOWN_trade >= $0.01 THEN place DOWN order
