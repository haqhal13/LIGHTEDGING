SECTION 4: INVENTORY WEIGHTING CALCULATION
================================================================================
How weighting works:
- deviation = current_ratio - target_ratio (0.50)
- weight = 1 - (deviation / max_skew_ratio)
- weight is clamped between 0 and 1
- Negative deviation (underweight) = weight clamped to 1.0
- Positive deviation (overweight) = weight reduced proportionally

SECTION 5: TILT TRADING BEHAVIOR (Price-Based Boost)
================================================================================
Tilt trading boosts the winning side when price >= 0.59 and reduces the losing side
Key values:
- tilt_threshold: 0.59 (when tilt starts)
- tilt_boost_multiplier: 1.25 (how much to boost winning side)
- price_stop_threshold: 0.90 (when losing side STOPS completely)
- Losing side: progressively reduced from 0.5x at threshold to 0x at price_stop

SECTION 10: DECISION FLOWCHART (Text Version)
================================================================================
Step 1: Determine market type (1-hour or 15-minute)
  IF market_type is "bitcoin-up-or-down" OR "ethereum-up-or-down" THEN use 1-hour sizing
  IF market_type is "btc-updown-15m" OR "eth-updown-15m" THEN use 15-minute sizing

Step 2: Calculate base trade sizes
  1-Hour: base = $0.50 + (price × 8.00), clamped $0.01-$14.00
  15-Minute: base = $0.25 + (price × 12.00), clamped $0.01-$26.00

Step 3: Check price stop threshold (0.90)
  IF UP_price >= 0.90 THEN DOWN_weight = 0 (stop trading DOWN)
  IF DOWN_price >= 0.90 THEN UP_weight = 0 (stop trading UP)

Step 4: Apply tilt boost (if not blocked by step 3)
  IF UP_price >= 0.59 THEN
    UP_boost = 1.25
    DOWN_boost = 0.5 × (1 - tiltProgress) where tiltProgress = (UP_price - 0.59) / (0.90 - 0.59)
  IF DOWN_price >= 0.59 THEN
    DOWN_boost = 1.25
    UP_boost = 0.5 × (1 - tiltProgress) where tiltProgress = (DOWN_price - 0.59) / (0.90 - 0.59)

Step 5: Calculate inventory weights (if not blocked by step 3)
  UP_deviation = current_UP_ratio - 0.50
  DOWN_deviation = current_DOWN_ratio - 0.50
  UP_weight = max(0, min(1, 1 - (UP_deviation / 0.20)))
  DOWN_weight = max(0, min(1, 1 - (DOWN_deviation / 0.20)))

Step 6: Calculate final trade amounts
  Final_UP_trade = base_UP × UP_tilt_boost × UP_weight
  Final_DOWN_trade = base_DOWN × DOWN_tilt_boost × DOWN_weight

Step 7: Execute trades
  IF Final_UP_trade >= $0.01 THEN place UP order
  IF Final_DOWN_trade >= $0.01 THEN place DOWN order
